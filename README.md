# 🚕 RideHer — Women Safety Ride Booking UI

RideHer is a **front-end web application prototype** of a women-focused ride booking platform designed to promote safer daily commuting.
The project focuses on user interface design, accessibility, and safety-centric user experience rather than backend implementation.

This project demonstrates practical front-end development skills including responsive layouts, UI structuring, and product interface thinking.

## 📌 About the Project

RideHer is a conceptual ride-hailing platform where female passengers can book rides with verified female drivers.
The application is designed as a **product UI simulation** — meaning the interface behaves like a real service, but does not connect to a server or database.

The aim of the project is to design how a safety-first transportation service could look and function from a user perspective.
